Data Source: 

The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV filecontaining information on WNBA players and selected certain columns  which included names, minutes played, and three-point shooting percentagesfor the 2024 season. I got this data by webscraping from the webiste: https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/years/2024_totals.html



Analyses Conducted:

In Question 1, I selected only relevant columns (Player, minutes played, and three-point percentage) and renamed them for clarity. I also counted the total number of players.

In Question 2, I created a histogram to visualize the distribution of three-point shooting percentages among players and I also incldued a summary of the three-point percentage was provided.

In Question 3, I plotted a scatter plot to explore the relationship between minutes played and three-point shooting percentage for all players. I highlighted  the player "Caitlin Clark" to visualize her individual placement on the graph.



Reproduction: 

Webscrape correctly, make sure it has 183 observations and 28 variables. Make sure to import the necessary libraries aswell.
